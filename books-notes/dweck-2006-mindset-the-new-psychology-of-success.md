## Mindset: The New Psychology of Success -- notes

(The ideas in this book combine nicely with the ideas in "Talent is Overrated",
"The Happiness Advantage", "Flow: Living at the Peak of Your Abilities", and
"Atomic Habits".)

If a person has a growth mindset, they believe that their abilities are not
fixed; by practicing they can learn and improve.

If a person has a fixed mindset, they believe that inherent ability is what
determines success.

For brevity, I will call a person with a growth mindset a GP, and a person with
a fixed mindset an FP.

### Characteristics of the two mindsets

Besides the actual definitions, Dweck associates several other
attitudes/characteristics to each mindset.

FPs tend to label themselves (and others) as a failure when they don't succeed
at something.
So, they are more hesitant to try new things, because if they fail it means that
they have no talent at that activity.

Failure for FPs is getting the wrong answer.
In contrast, failure for GPs is stagnation: not learning and growing.

GPs bounce back from failure more easily, are more prone to challenges, and more
willing to take risks.

GPs may also believe in natural talent.
But they believe that it is impossible to determine a person's ceiling in
advance.
You can only see how far you can go by trying.

FPs tend to make excuses when they don't succeed, instead of shouldering the
blame.
If they admit to themselves that the reason for the failure is that their level
wasn't high enough, that is a devastating conclusion.

FPs don't value high effort.
If you try hard at something and don't succeed, you can't make any excuses.
An FP may say "I could have been top in my field".
But had they actually tried hard to do it, they would understand how hard it is,
so they wouldn't say things like that.

In contrast, GPs value effort, and want to say "I gave it my all on this, and I
value that journey even if I didn't end up going as far as I wanted".

GPs are better predictors of their performance on a task.
That's because they have gotten more practice trying things.
FPs don't try new things as much, so they can't estimate their ability well.

Dweck mentions that GPs are always challenging themselves.
They are ambitious, over-achievers (she doesn't use these words, but that's what
comes across from the examples).
I'm not really like that, even though I believe I'm a growth-minded person.

Goes on to soften the dichotomy a bit.
Says that mindset is a continuum.
People can have elements of both mindsets, not be fully one or the other.
Or they may have one mindset in an area (believing their abilities there are
fixed) and a different mindset in another area.

Mindset itself can be taught.
You can start with a fixed mindset and adopt a growth mindset.
Dweck herself had a fixed mindset and later embraced growth.

Keeps hammering this point: avoid labeling yourself and others, blaming and
judging.
In the growth mindset, criticism and setbacks are opportunities for improvement.
You analyze them in a non-emotional way and learn from them.

IMO this is hard to do, especially when the criticism is delivered by a person
who often belittles others.
In that case, you have to learn to ignore the criticism.
Don't label yourself; just keep honing your craft and focus on self improvement.

When there are issues, GPs do not pretend that everything is fine, and don't
sweep problems under the rug; they address them.
(OTOH, FPs may pretend that everything is fine, because if they admit the truth
to themselves, the reality of the situation may cause them to admit a failure on
their part.)

GPs are comfortable with negative feedback and confrontation, so they address
problems before they grow more.
Good advice IMO, but takes some courage to implement.

### Mindset in sports, schools, relationships, and other areas

[Marva Collins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marva_Collins) was a teacher who
believed in the growth mindset, and was able to instill it into low-income
inner city kids and help them learn successfully.

[Betty Edwards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Edwards) was able to
deconstruct drawing ability into skills that are teachable, and teach people who
thought they couldn't draw.

[John wooden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wooden) was a great college
basketball coach, who had the growth mindset.
Took UCLA from mediocre all the way to the top.
He was the coach of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

[Bob Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Knight) was another successful
coach, who had a fixed mindset.
He constantly threw fits and insulted people.
He was the coach of Isiah Thomas.

Dweck mentions many examples of FPs who made it to the top, but couldn't stay
there because of their mindset.
My alternative takeaway is that both mindsets can succeed.
So, in the workplace, you have to be careful about what kind of person you are
interacting with, especially if you struggle with self doubt.
An FP is more likely to make demeaning comments.

FPs believe that if something requires effort then you aren't a natural.
Applied to relationships, they believe that in the right relationship everything
should flow smoothly.
If effort is required to make the relationship strong, then it isn't the right
one.
Marriage experts (who have seen lots of couples) say that every marriage 
requires effort to stay healthy.

Talks about school bullying.
When the child being bullied has a fixed mindset, they start to believe the
taunts and think worse of themselves.
A child with a growth mindset recognizes that they did nothing to deserve this,
and the bully has problems of their own that cause this behavior.

When kids are being praised for their intelligence or talent, it harms them down
the line because they don't take on difficult tasks in the fear of failing and
appearing untalented.
Or they stop believing in the value of hard work and think talent is enough to
succeed.

When they are praised for effort, it has positive long term effects.

A child may adopt a fixed mindset at school.
I do my HW fast because I'm smart, or I learn faster than others, etc.
A parent can respond to such a comment with "Oh too bad, if you can answer 
everything quickly and it comes easy, it means you are not learning much."
Teach the child to value effort, not view it as something untalented kids do to
catch up.

Being a growth minded person is a work in progress, and the principles should
keep being applied even if things look good at the moment.

Discusses an example of a parent who would shout at their child when they did
something wrong.
Then, the parent tried the principles of the growth mindset, and the situation
improved.
But then, the parent stopped applying the principles, and the behavior reverted,
and the parent's anger returned.
