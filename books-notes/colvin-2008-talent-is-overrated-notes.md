## Talent is overrated -- notes

(Not a summary of the book; just misc notes of what I want to remember.)

The thesis of the book is that most people can become high achievers (even
world-class performers) in their field through deliberate practice.
According to the author, this finding is well understood in the relevant
research circles, even though the public at large believes that great performers
are born, not made.

### Ch 1 - 3: Intro; innate abilities may help but are not a prerequisite

Discusses Mozart, who is the quintessential example of a genius.
Shows that his amazing music was mostly a result of extremely hard and rigorous
training, as opposed to an innate ability.
His father trained him from age 3, and maybe tweaked his early childhood
compositions.
Mozart wrote some early symphonies that contained no original music.
He was 21 when he composed his first masterpiece, 18 years after he started
training hard.

When someone at a conference made the case that Mozart's greatness was the
result of hard work, it caused a big stir.
People love perpetuating genius stories, which makes it harder to break the
pattern.

In addition, a person's greatness is evaluated very differently in different
eras.
For example, Bach became an all-time great long after his death.
Therefore, one's greatness is as much due to the public's opinion of their work
as it is about their own abilities.
This fact deemphasizes the importance of natural gifts.
It also tells us that, on top of our work, we need to put in the effort to make
the public appreciate our work.
The work doesn't always speak for itself.

Discusses Tiger Woods, who is often mentioned as a golf genius, and shows how he
also achieved his amazing accomplishments after hard training for 15+ years,
starting at age 2.

The book first makes the case that activity-specific talent (such as a music
gene) either doesn't exist, or is not a prerequisite for high achievement.
Then, one could counter that general intelligence (e.g., high IQ) or a great
memory is required.
So, the book proceeds to show that these are not needed either.

Anders Ericsson, the preeminent researcher on high achievement through
deliberate practice, performed an experiment to measure people's ability to
remember random digits after hearing them once.
The average was 7, with 9 or 10 being rare.
He was able to train students that did not show prior signs of amazing memory to
remember more than 100 digits!
This is a stunning difference.
Could the brain be learning to devote more circuitry to the activity as one
practices more?

Top performers have extraordinary skills and memory *specifically* for their
domain.
The skills do not transfer.
Examples:  
*  In an experiment, chess experts could remember boards after seeing them only
   once whereas amateurs could remember only a few pieces.
   However, if they were presented with boards of random arrangements, chess
   experts were only slightly better than avg.
   Their memory was specific to real chess positions.
*  The person who learned to memorize series of digits couldn't memorize series
   of random letters.
*  When asked, Kasparov said that ability to play chess well is just that, it
   does not translate to other abilities.
*  Musicians distinguish subtly different music tones, but can't distinguish
   different voice tones better than average.

### Ch 4 - 6: Deliberate practice

Jerry Rice is the GOAT wide receiver in the NFL.
A brief calculation shows that less than 1% of his football-related time was
spent on actually playing football.
He spent most of his time on very targeted drills such as physical conditioning,
watching film, practicing specific plays with the quarterback only, etc.
Rice intensely practiced receiver-specific skills, not "general football"
skills.

"The role of deliberate practice in the acquisition of expert performance"  
Important paper by Ericsson that studied how people in various disciplines can
become top performers.
E.g., violin players who had accumulated the most hours of individual practice
were the best ones.
Unsurprisingly, it is much easier to accumulate these hours if one starts in
childhood, before having adult responsibilities.

Deliberate practice, as described in the book, sounds like hill climbing.
So, in theory, you can be trapped in local maxima.
But in reality, people who use deliberate practice become extremely good, so it
is worth trying.

Author's definition of deliberate practice:  
1. Designed by a teacher, specifically to improve performance.
2. Pushes you just beyond your current limits.
   Comfort zone (where we usually are) vs learning zone (where deliberate
   practice takes us) vs panic zone (just too hard to be useful).
3. It can be repeated a lot.
4. Feedback on results is continuously available.
5. Highly demanding mentally.
   Requires concentration, focus, always seeking areas for improvement.
   It is so demanding that sessions typically last no more than 60 to 90
   minutes.
6. It isn't much fun. We are seeking out what we aren't good at and repeating
   it.

For software engineering, deliberate practice may mean to practice domain
specific or even project specific skills at the expense of general programming.
Specialize highly.
The skills don't transfer to new teams, but the ability to learn highly specific
things does.

The three Polgar sisters were trained rigorously in chess by their father, a
psychologist who believed in deliberate practice but wasn't a good chess player,
and they all achieved stellar success.

As an aside, the author mentions that Gladwell's 10K hour rule is a
mischaracterization of Ericsson's work on deliberate practice.
* 10K was the average number of hours practiced by top violinists by age 20.
  But they continue practicing and getting better, and accumulate many more
  hours in their career.
* 10K is not a magic number that transfers to every field.
* Practicing many hours is not enough, deliberate practice is required to become
  world class.

Colvin makes the dubious claim that top performers don't allow themselves to
perform their task mechanically / without thinking.
(The motivating example is some golfer who stopped mid-shot to regroup.)
But we know from neuroscience that muscle memory and the subconscious are very
important in skills like hitting a baseball, or playing a hard piece on the
piano.

How does deliberate practice work?

1. Top performers accumulate tons of domain specific knowledge.
2. They are able to recall their knowledge on the spot. Their domain-specific
   memory is impressive.

Suppose that you see the word "lexicographic" for a few seconds, and then asked
to write down the letters in order from memory.
For someone who knows English, this is simple.
But a non-English speaker needs to memorize the letters in order quickly.
By knowing the word, our brain needs to store only one piece of information.

This is how top performers achieve great domain-specific memory.
They combine their bits of knowledge into high-level concepts, and those into
yet higher-level concepts, and so on.
They develop a rich vocabulary of their discipline, which allows them to store
more information, and recall it faster.

Benjamin Franklin developed his own practice method for writing, and used it to
become a great writer.
He found an essay X that he liked.

* To improve his phrasing, he took notes on each sentence of X.
  Then, after he'd forgotten X, he tried to recreate it from his notes, and
  compared to the original.
* To improve his vocabulary, he rewrote X in verse, then waited again, and wrote
  it back in regular style and compared to the original.
* Last, to improve his order of presenting the facts, he shuffled his notes of
  each sentence, then after he'd forgotten the essay, he tried to find the right
  order and recreate the essay, and compared to the original.

He didn't improve by writing lots of essays, but by targeting the individual
elements he was trying to improve.
Very clever system.

Deliberate practice allows experts to work around physical limitations.
For example, top tennis players defend a serve by reading the opponent's body
while the ball is still in the air, to predict the serve's location.
Top typists are faster by reading further ahead.
In studies when they were not able to do that, they were only a little better
than average.

### Ch 7 - 10: Applying the principles in one's life, or in their place of work

I didn't enjoy these chapters as much.
They include lots of content that is only tangentially related to deliberate
practice, e.g., how trust is very important in a team.

A person can try to find opportunities for deliberate practice while doing their
regular work: observe themselves while they are performing a task, set specific
subgoals (e.g., not just "do it") and evaluate themselves later.
When top performers don't do well on a task, they tend to put the blame on
themselves (and have an actionable plan for a fix), whereas avg performers tend
to put the blame on circumstances beyond their control.

The book's arguments can be weak in places, and the connection to deliberate
practice tenuous, e.g., the author tends to name successful activities (such as
the Beatles' success) deliberate practice after the fact, to fit his narrative.
Nevertheless, there are many useful nuggets in the book to draw from.

Top performers keep performing at a very high level even as they age, even
though they decline in general skills like everyone else.
Their hard practiced skills decline much more slowly.
An encouraging message.

### Ch 11: Where does the motivation / passion come from?

What makes some people willing to go through the extreme multi-year effort
required to become top performers?

#### Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation

Intrinsic is more important.
Extrinsic can be helpful if it can tie back to intrinsic, e.g., external
recognition meaning that the person has succeeded in becoming great.
Or it can instill some urgency, e.g., a scientist fearing of being scooped by
another, or a child made to practice by their parents.
But extrinsic motivation was also harmful in some studies, e.g., knowing that
one's work will be judged produced lower quality results.
(Creativity stifled?)

Child prodigies often don't go on to become top performers in their field.
They may burn out, or they know that everything comes easy to them, and when
they inevitably hit a wall, they get disappointed instead of persevering.
Also, many top performers were not prodigies, and showed no special inclination
in childhood.

#### The multiplier effect

Where does the drive to practice come from?
A little success generates satisfaction and ability to practice more, which
generates more success and ability, in a virtuous cycle that can result in top
performance.

The initial success can be due to innate traits, due to starting earlier than
other kids, or just due to praise from parents or coaches, making the child feel
special.
