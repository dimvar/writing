## Flow: living at the peak of your abilities -- notes

The state of flow is a psychological state where a person is focused, and 
engaged in what they are doing, and their mind isn't traveling elsewhere.
It is a state of undivided attention.
The author spent his career studying flow and trying to understand what makes
people happy.
He interviewed many people from various backgrounds and professions.

The author was a child during WWII.
He saw many devastated people, but also a few people that were able to maintain
their spirit and lift others.
He wondered what makes those people happy and resilient.
That's how he got into psychology and came to the US.

The way he describes flow, it sounds very related (but not identical) to the
state of "being present", as discussed in meditation readings. 
He claims a person can be in a constant state of flow in their life, not just at
work.

He recommends that for each activity, even mundane ones, a person can create
small goals and then trying to accomplish them.
This gives you something to aim for, and makes it harder to perform the activity
mindlessly.
Interesting idea (kind of like gamification of boring tasks), but I'm sure it can
be an overkill at times too.

His research group interviewed various people and asked them about their mental
state while they perform their craft.
They also gave people pagers, and occasionally paged them throughout the day,
asking them to fill out a questionnaire about their present activity and mental
state.

People who experience flow describe it using some or all of these eight
components:

* The activity has a clear goal to be accomplished.
* Feedback is immediate; you know in the moment how well you are doing.
* The challenges of the activity match your skills. Not too hard, not too easy.
  You are being usefully challenged.
* State of focus. Attention is not divided like in everyday life.
* You forget the frustrations of everyday life while in the flow state. Sounds
  like a byproduct of undivided attention.
* You have control of the outcome of the activity. Your actions matter. You can
  effect change.
* You lose track of self/ego/self judgment because of your focus on the
  activity.
* The passage of time is distorted; you lose track of time.

Then he describes what he calls a "complex personality".
I forget the definition, but it roughly means a person that is deliberate about
what they do in life; they don't go about aimlessly.
They seek to learn and grow.

The five Cs of a complex personality:

* Clarity of long-term and short-term goals. Clarity of feedback.
* Center. The ability to focus.
* Choice. The understanding that there are many possibilities in life, and you
  aren't trapped where you are; you are choosing it.
* Commit. Not choosing half-heartedly, but applying oneself.
* Challenge. Doing something that requires all your skills; it is not too easy
  for you.

Then talks about people who bring their attention to their current activity and
find ways to make it interesting.
Even mundane stuff like being stuck in traffic, or being in the waiting room of
a doctor's office.

Talks about ways to get in the flow state.
One way is via our body, e.g., by walking mindfully, or by practicing yoga.

He contrasts flow with what he calls psychic entropy, a state of diffused
thoughts and attention.
The mind is running to various places and worrying, like when we are stressed.

Tells a nice story about a Hungarian poet who wrote in prison, and taught his
verses to other inmates.
This gave them something to help them keep going.

While talking about flow at work, he says that there are two main reasons why
people dislike their jobs: when the job is repetitive/uninteresting, and when
a person doesn't get along with their boss.

Proposes a kind of gamification: view work interactions as little challenges that
you need to solve/overcome.

Says that children can more easily and spontaneously get into flow than adults,
and be absorbed in what they are doing.
(Children also have a short attention span though.)

Mentions a famous physicist (without naming him) who after retirement at seventy
went to France and became a cook, and published several cookbooks that were
widely read in Europe.
Two of his students won the Nobel prize.
Is it Nicholas Kurti?

Important insight: mental tiredness after a task happens when we performed the
task while thinking about other things.
That's when it feels like a drudge.
When we perform a task and we are involved in it, it usually feels good.
Being in a state of undivided attention is very pleasant.

He mentions surgeons many times in the book as a profession where people often
achieve flow.
He says that surgeons are so addicted to their job, that sometimes while on
vacation they volunteer at a local hospital to perform surgeries :P
(I'm guessing this only happened at older times.)
