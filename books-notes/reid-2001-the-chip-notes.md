The book tells the story of Jack Kilby and Bob Noyce and how they invented the
integrated circuit.
Contains lots of background too, on physics, boolean logic and binary numbers,
and basic circuits.

The Edison effect led to J.J. Thompson's experiments that helped him discover
the electron and explain electricity as a flow of electrons.

J.J. Thompson and 7 of his students won a Nobel prize.

Goes through the background of semiconductors.
The Edison effect led to the discovery of the electron and the vacuum tube.
The vacuum tube solved problems with radios and enabled radio to become a
commercial technology.
Semiconductor materials were known to physicists, but crystal sets (radios based
on semiconductors) were not reliable.

Niels Bohr figured out the structure of the atom, and why the conductors,
semiconductors, and insulators differ in how easily they conduct current.
Conductors have fewer than 4 electrons in the outer ring.
Insulators have more than 4.
Semiconductors have exactly 4 electrons in the outer ring.
By adding impurities, you can make a p-type semiconductor or an n-type
(positively or negatively charged).

In a piece of semiconductor where one end is p and the other n, the middle point
is called the p-n junction.
The first transistor, invented by Bardeen and Brattain, was called
point-contact transistor.
Shortly after, Shockley invented a new one called junction transistor, which
uses a NPN semiconductor.
Transistors can perform amplification and on/off switching.

Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments (TI) and Bob Noyce at Fairchild independently
invented the integrated circuit. Kilby invented it a few months before Noyce.

Kilby has developed his own theory of invention.
A point he keeps making is to tune out the obvious solutions because they have
already been tried, and look for non obvious solutions.
IMO, it is also important to understand why obvious solutions to a problem fail.

He applied to MIT for college and narrowly failed the entrance exam, and hadn't
applied anywhere else.
So, he then put together a quick application for the University of Illinois.

TI was the first company to make silicon transistors.
Before that, they were made from germanium.
Silicon could work on higher temperatures, but it was harder to work with than
germanium.

The tyranny of numbers problem: before the integrated circuit, each circuit
element (transistor, resistor, capacitor) was separate, and they all had to be
soldered together to make a circuit.
Doing all these connections by hand was extremely time consuming and unreliable.

When Kilby went to TI, he tried to solve the tyranny of numbers problem.
He realized that he could make resistors and capacitors out of silicon (they
were made of other materials then), and if he could do so, then he could make
all components of a circuit on the same piece of silicon, so no wires and manual
soldering were required.
It was a very non obvious idea, because resistors and capacitors out of silicon
wouldn't be as good as their predecessors, and they'd be more expensive.

Kilby tended to work alone.
Bob Noyce was the opposite.
He was very social, and worked with others a lot.
He had a bazillion interests, including sports, language learning, music,
planes.
He gravitated towards leadership positions in whatever he was involved in.

At Fairchild, they invented a process of coating the silicon wafer with an oxide
to prevent impurities.
While studying this process, Noyce realized that he could print connections to
a transistor's regions on the oxide, and from that realized that he could create
several circuit elements on the same wafer, and connect them in the same way.

The author then gives a brief overview of the patent system in the US.

When someone makes an invention, they have two options.
They can keep it a secret and productize it.
If they keep it a secret, and someone else illicitly figures out their recipe,
the inventor can take that person to court.
But if someone invents the same thing independently, the original inventor can't
do anything about it.
A famous example is the inventor of coca cola, who kept his recipe a secret.

The other option is to file for a patent.
In the patent, they have to disclose how the invention works, so that others
can also build it and improve on it.
But then, the inventor gets protection not only from people who may steal it,
but from independent inventors as well.
The protection lasts twenty years.
Patent filing is commonly done in electronics, because the useful life of an
invention is less than twenty years anyway.

When filing for a patent, it can be written as a sword or as a shield.
A sword patent uses broad language to describe a very novel invention, so that
the filer can sue others who infringe.
A shield patent uses very detailed language to describe an invention that builds
on a prior one, to very clearly differentiate from the prior one, so that the
filer can defend themselves in court if the early inventor sues.

Kilby's patent was a sword and Noyce's was a shield.
Kilby rushed to file because of a false rumor that RCA was also developing an
integrated circuit.
In the patent, the circuit used wires to connect the components, and there was
a brief description of how one could potentially print the connections instead.

Noyce filed because of true rumors that TI had invented the IC.
In his patent, the connections were printed and very clearly described how that
was done.
Kilby had invented first, but Noyce's invention was more complete.

There was a very lengthy patent battle between the two companies that ended up
in the Supreme Court.
Noyce ended up getting awarded the patent.
But in the meantime, the companies had formed an agreement to both license the
technology, independently of the judicial outcome.

Due to the space race, the US government was the first big buyer of ICs.
This helped the technology improve and get cheaper.

Before ICs, TI developed a transistor radio that was the "killer product" that
helped transistors become mainstream.
The killer product for ICs was the pocket calculator, also developed by TI.
It seems utterly mundane today, but the first pocket calculator was an amazing
invention.

W.E. Deming: engineer who pioneered statistical quality control in production.
He argued that every element of the process must be tracked statistically, and
errors identified quickly.
He said that finding errors at that stage was cheaper than inspecting after the
product is complete and discarding defective products.
His methods were used by the Japanese electronics industry to achieve dominance.

In a speech in Japan, Deming predicted that Japanese manufacturing would become
the best in the world.
He knew it even before they did.
Eventually, his ideas were widely adopted in Japan, and he received the highest
civilian honor.

The last chapter covers Kilby's and Noyce's lives after the invention of the IC.

Kilby left TI at some point to become an independent inventor, in order to have
full creative freedom.
But later he ended up consulting with TI often.
Something to be said here about larger goals and working in teams; it helps
people focus.
