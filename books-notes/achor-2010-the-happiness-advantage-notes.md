## The happiness advantage -- notes

### Intro

The book's ideas are based on research in the field of positive psychology. In psychology, the large majority of studies look at causes of unhappiness (e.g., depression, alcoholism) and how to help people get back to normal; their baseline mood. Positive psychology proposes to study "happiness outliers" and take what they do, so that more people's baseline mood goes from neutral to happy.

Studies will often transform a question like "how fast can a child learn to read" to "how fast does the average child learn to read". This way, they miss the opportunity to study outliers, and take what they do for everyone to copy.

On the news, you don't see a statistically accurate picture of the world; you see news that generate views. So, they don't generally report on commonplace things (that's boring). By definition, they have to report on rare, unexpected things. They also overly focus on unhappy events. This fools your brain into overly worrying about the negatives in the world, instead of a more balanced view.

How can one learn to become more optimistic?

The author also talks about the brain's plasticity. Scientists used to believe that a person's brain changes very little after adolescence. Now, fMRI experiments show that this is not the case, and we can learn new things even at an advanced age. For example, London cab drivers have a much larger than average hippocampus (responsible for memory). The Braille finger of a blind person activates a much larger area of the brain than their other index finger.

He also mentions that the common wisdom is that happiness follows success; if you become successful then you will be happy. But it is easy to see why this is false. Once people achieve something, after a quick emotional high, they move the goalposts to the next thing and return to their baseline mood, and push happiness further in the future. In reality, success follows happiness: if you are happy, you are more likely to become successful.

The author tells a story of how, when he got into Harvard, he felt so much gratitude and he considered it a privilege to just be there. Because he focused on that, it was easier to do better on classes/exams compared to the students who felt super stressed.

The author proposes 7 principles that help make people happy, and as a result more successful at work. IMO, while that's useful, happiness is also its own reward; success at work is secondary. The science in the book can be a bit shaky (e.g., the Losada line), but the 7 principles seem useful and worth trying.

### The happiness advantage

The idea that happiness causes success, not the other way around.

The author discusses studies where people who had been primed with happy thoughts performed better on various tasks. Argues that a happy person tends to have a clearer head than a stressed person.

Some ways of improving one's baseline happiness (daily mood) are:

* Meditation
* Exercise
* Find things to look forward to (schedule time with friends, trips, etc).
* Increase positivity in your surroundings, and decrease negativity (e.g., put pictures of your loved ones at your desk, avoid negative TV).
* Exercise a signature strength (draw, play music, whatever) or a signature character trait (see [here](https://www.viacharacter.org/)).
* Spend money on experiences instead of things.

Uses the phrase "construction of happiness" instead of "pursuit of happiness", that is, happiness is a state of mind that we create by deliberately working on it; it is not something outside of us that we must find. (Assuming one's basic needs are met of course.)

### The fulcrum and the lever

The idea that our mindset, i.e., how we interpret an experience, is really powerful, and can change the experience itself. Because the way we experience the world is via our brain's model of the world, there is a large subjective component to each experience. Our brain shapes our experiences.

The placebo effect is the most well known way of how our brain changes our experience. Many experiments have found that people who take placebos often experience relief from their symptoms, just because their brain tells them they are taking real medication.

Reverse placebo effect: Japanese study where the experimenter blindfolded people who are allergic to poison ivy, then told them that he/she will rub their arm with poison ivy. In reality, it was a harmless plant. But several of the people developed symptoms. Then, the experimenter told them that they will get a harmless plant on the other arm, but used poison ivy. Only a small percentage of the people experienced symptoms on that arm.

Experiment where the cleaning staff at a hotel were told about the exercise value of their work, and a few weeks after being told, they lost weight. The control group was told nothing, and they didn't lose weight.

When you see a task as a chore, it becomes a chore. If you see it as a learning opportunity, you find something to learn.

Thinking of one's strengths instead of weaknesses right before a stressful task (e.g., giving a public talk) increases chances of success.

Psychologist Carol Dweck coined the term "growth mindset". This means that a person believes in their ability to learn and improve on any particular task. The opposite is "fixed mindset". People with a growth mindset tend to persist more when they stumble, tend to take on more challenges and become more successful.

People who view their job as a calling, instead of just as a way to pay the bills, perform better (regardless of profession). The author suggests writing down the things that most excite you about your job; how would you pitch your job to someone else? Not lying or inflating things, just genuinely looking for the aspects that matter most to you.

Mentions the Pygmalion effect: when our belief in another person's potential becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and brings that potential to life. \
Caution: the study that discovered the effect has been discredited. See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect).

### The Tetris effect

The idea that when we do an activity X repeatedly, our brain becomes better and better in recognizing X patterns everywhere.

The name comes from a study where college students were paid to play Tetris for several hours a day for a few days in a row. Afterwards, they couldn't stop spotting Tetris patterns everywhere in the real world.

The author says that most people tend to spot the negatives of a situation, and as a result become better and better at it. Instead, if a person makes an effort to spot positives, it becomes easier for them to spot opportunities instead of seeing hardships and imperfection everywhere.

To stop seeing only the negative and see the positive (and to capitalize on the positive), we must first understand how much of our experience is subjective. The brain sees what it chooses to focus on and discards the rest. When you are looking for a pattern, you see it everywhere.

For example, there is the famous gorilla experiment. Participants were asked to look at a video of people throwing a ball to each other, and count the number of passes. Mid-video, a person in a gorilla costume walks along the screen. Most participants didn't even see it, and didn't believe it afterwards that they could have missed such an obvious thing.

One way to see the positives more easily is by becoming more grateful. The author mentions studies where people who became more grateful became happier.

Another way to learn to scan for positives is to do a daily exercise where you write down three *specific* good things that happened to you that day. By making yourself do that even on bad days, the brain learns to more easily identify the positives.

### Falling up

Making the best of one's hardships and failures, and taking these lessons to fuel future success.

Post traumatic growth: a condition where after a very bad event happens to someone, they emerge from it with newfound appreciation for their life. It is rarer than PTSD but it is well documented that it happens.

Companies will sometimes make mistakes on purpose, to see how the org responds.

Learned helplessness: psychology experiments on animals and humans, where once the subject is made to believe that they have no control over stopping a bad situation, they don't even try (even though there is a positive path forward).

The counterfactual story you tell yourself about an event ("things could have gone that way instead") influences whether you interpret the event as good or bad. You need something to compare the event to.

Optimistic explanatory style: when someone believes that adversity is local and temporary, as opposed to someone who believes it is widespread and here to stay. The former people find it easier to bounce back.

Martin Seligman: psychologist who has done work in this area.

ABCD: an exercise you can go through to improve your explanatory style.

* Adversity: the bad event; something we can't change.
* Belief: our opinion of the event. Is it localized in one area of our life? Is it temporary?
* Consequence: based on B, what we think the outlook is.
* Disputation: if we believe the event is global and long lasting, start a dialogue with ourselves and question the belief. How airtight is it? Look for other interpretations.

### The Zorro circle

Start small and gradually master harder and bigger things and expand your sphere of influence. Confine yourself to a zone where you can be successful, and gradually expand your reach.

The name comes from a Zorro film, where as Zorro was starting out, his trainer drew a circle on the ground and forced him to fight from that circle. Once he mastered that, they moved on to other goals.

Internal vs external locus of control: the belief that your circumstances are mainly influenced by your actions vs by external forces outside your control. People who believe their actions influence their outcomes have lower stress and more success, compared to people who think they have no control.

Psychologists who focus on goal setting advocate for goals of moderate difficulty; not so easy that we know exactly how to accomplish them, or so hard that we can't even get started. Working at the limit of one's ability is also part of the deliberate practice method (see the book "Talent is overrated").

When consulting, the author often asks overwhelmed clients to create two lists: of things they can and cannot control at work. Then, he finds doable tasks for them in the former pile and tells them to not worry much about the latter pile. This helps them get going and stop feeling helpless.

At the end of the chapter, the author mentions the "broken windows theory" and how it was applied in NYC to reduce crime. However, the theory is controversial. See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory).

### The twenty second rule

When trying to achieve a goal, it is better to rely on habit than on willpower. Willpower is a limited resource that gets depleted easily. When something becomes a habit, it is easier for us to do it. For something to become a habit, we must lower the barrier to entry, the effort required to get started.

Common sense is not common action: people often know what the right thing is, e.g., not smoking, but actually doing it is very hard.

Make good habits the path of least resistance.

The easiest it is to start doing something, the more likely we are to do it (e.g., this is why people spend lots of time watching TV or browsing, even though they enjoy other activities more).

Examples

* take the batteries out of the TV remote
* put unhealthy snacks in cupboards where you don't see them often
* prepare healthy snacks ahead of time (because in the moment, they are more time consuming to prepare than junk food).
* take some junk food from the bag and put the bag back instead of eating straight from the bag.

Important: the idea is *not* to remove the bad options, but make it harder to do them; make the default setting be the good option. Then, the brain doesn't believe that stuff is taken away; you are not exerting as much willpower to do the right thing. And as the desired behavior becomes a habit, it becomes more and more automatic.

### Social investment

The strength of one's social ties is the strongest predictor of happiness and success, according to many studies.

Having a strong social network multiplies one's intellectual, emotional, and physical abilities, allowing us to do more.

In hardship, most people weaken their social ties and go at it alone, whereas the best strategy is to strengthen the ties and dig out of the hard moment as a team.

Some research suggests that how we support people in good times correlates more with the strength of the relationship than how we support them in difficult times. Counterintuitive to me.

### Epilogue

Describes how emotions spread easily in a social setting.

Describes mirror neurons in the brain. When a person looks at someone experiencing an emotion, they often experience the emotion themselves due to mirror neurons in the brain.

The author claims that mirror neurons are the basis why emotions spread easily in group settings. So, overly positive people pass on positivity to those around them, but overly negative people also pass on negativity. Interesting to think of emotions as being contagious.
