## Atomic habits -- notes

The premise of the book is that a person can make small changes to their daily
habits, and over the years these changes pay off greatly.

Lots of the examples in the book are from sports, which are more regimented and
than science, and the process of improvement is more well understood.

Talks about the process vs the goal, and recommends focusing on the process.
Consistent process helps you achieve the goal.
Also, if you "fall in love with the process", then you are satisfied in the
present moment, as opposed to waiting for potential satisfaction in the future.

Interesting idea: your identity, who you are, shapes your habits and your life.
So, when you are trying to change something, don't focus on the end result,
focus on changing your identity, who you want to become.
The person you want to be finds it natural to do the habit you are trying to
establish.
And it is a virtuous cycle.
By doing the habit, you are reinforcing that identity, so it becomes easier over
time.

The habit loop:

* Cue: an external stimulus that your brain reacts to.
* Craving: the cue triggers some desire in your brain.
* Response: you take action to satisfy the craving.
* Reward: you feel temporary satisfaction due to your action.

To form a habit, he proposes techniques that can be applied to each step in the
process.

* Make it obvious: put cues of the new habit in your environment.
* Make it attractive: create a craving to entice the brain towards the habit.
* Make it easy: remove obstacles so that the habit can be easily performed, and
  the barrier to entry is very low.
* Make it satisfying: tweak the habit in ways that make you feel good right
  after you have performed the habit, so that you are inclined to do it again.

To break a habit, roughly the reverse steps:

* Make it invisible.
* Make it unattractive.
* Make it hard to do; increase the barrier to entry.
* Make it unsatisfying.

The cue for a habit usually triggers the craving subconsciously.
Since we don't notice this, it is hard to break existing habits.

The first step is awareness.
Create a habit scorecard.
Observe and write down your existing habits from the moment you wake up, and
label each as positive or negative based on the identity you are working
towards.

### Make it obvious

Implementation intention: when you make a specific plan about the new habit, you
are more likely to do it, because the cue becomes more obvious.
For example, "I will perform habit x at time y in place z".

The brain is predisposed to perform the same actions in sequence.
Therefore, a more effective way for implementation intention is habit stacking:
I will perform new habit x after existing habit y.
You insert the new habit into your routine.

The environment affects a person's choices subconsciously.
E.g., people are more likely to buy things at eye level in a store.
Therefore, you can alter your environment to help you with a new habit.
The stronger you want the habit to be, the more obvious the visual cues should
be in the environment.

The brain easily associates various places with specific activities.
If you want to break a habit, one way is to avoid or alter the environment where
it happens.
At home, it helps to have separate spaces for different activities, e.g., the
couch is just for relaxing, not for working as well.
Then, the barriers in the brain are lowered.

Once the brain creates a habit, it takes years to forget.
If you find yourself in the setting where you perform the habit, the brain wants
to do it.
That is why it is almost impossible to rely on willpower to stop a bad habit
long term.
It is much easier to change the environment to remove the queues.
Not relying on willpower is a general theme in the book.

One more advantage of implementation intention is that you set your schedule
ahead of time, when your mind is clear.
When you don't do this, you try to make a decision in the moment about what to
do next, and it is easy for the brain to be swayed by impulses.
A schedule makes things easier because it removes decisions during the day.

### Make it attractive

Supernormal stimuli: scientists have performed experiments on animals and found
particular stimuli that are very hard to resist.
For example, a bird mother who is used to rolling eggs back to the nest will
roll other round objects as well, even large ones such as a volleyball.
The author mentions that humans also are hyper sensitive to some stimuli, e.g.,
we crave high-calorie foods with lots of carbs, because food was hard to come by
for early humans.
But now this craving doesn't serve us well anymore.

When the human brain anticipates a reward, it releases dopamine.
Experiments in mice find that blocking dopamine eliminates desire, even to eat
and drink.
Note that the anticipation of a reward is not the same as the pleasure one gets
when experiencing the reward.

Temptation bundling: a way to exploit the brain's reward system in order to
create a habit.
You pair up something you need to do with something you want to do.
The idea is to make the habit attractive. Examples:

* Person who hooked up Netflix to their exercise bike.
* When I finish task X, I will browse sports news for 10 minutes.

It seems to me that this strategy has dangers because you usually pair the new
habit with something that isn't beneficial for you in the long run, and you
increase your dependence on that questionable reward.

Mentions the story of the Polgar sisters (also mentioned in Talent is
Overrated), and says that their dad had decided to make his kids world class at
chess before he was even married!
He wanted to prove that top performance is a result of practice, not innate
ability.

Then mentions the great desire of humans to fit in.
So, if you want to take up a habit, it is good to become part of a community
that has this habit: working out, computers, entrepreneurship, etc.
Because you are trying to fit in, the habit becomes attractive.
Similarly, if you want to break a habit, you can stop participating in the
community that has the habit.

Mentions a story about a person in a wheelchair that was asked, how does it feel
to be confined in the wheelchair.
The person replied, I'm not confined by my wheelchair, I'm liberated by it.
If I didn't have it, I'd be in bed all day.
This ability to find the positive in a situation reminds me of the story in the
Happiness Advantage, where people had to imagine a bank robbery where they were
present.
Generally a useful skill to be able to find positives in a situation.

### Make it easy

Before starting a difficult activity, you can perform a short ritual to get in
the right mindset, kind of like what athletes do before a game.

Talks about the importance of repetition in making a behavior more automatic.

Making a habit easy to do increases the chance that we will stick to it.
Conversely, making a bad habit harder helps us stop it.
You can change your environment to do that. Examples:

* Setting out workout clothes the night before.
* Preparing healthy snacks in containers ahead of time, so that when you are
  hungry they are readily available.
* Placing your phone in a different room during focus time.

It is natural for a person to keep doing what they are already doing.
Therefore, some little choices throughout the day play a big role, e.g., turning
on the TV after work instead of changing into workout clothes.
Or grabbing the phone to check something and suddenly thirty minutes pass by.

So, a habit can be just that moment of choice, not the whole activity.
He mentions a trick where you start a habit, and for the first few days you do
it only for two minutes.
The idea is that you master showing up, then later you can optimize.
Once the two minutes are over, it is natural to just keep going.

Another tip is to perform the activity for as much time as it is still
enjoyable, and stop before it becomes a chore.
Then your brain doesn't think of it like a chore, and it becomes easier to do it
on a daily basis.

Commitment device: an action you take ahead of time to make a bad habit
difficult, so when you are in the moment later, it takes more effort to do the
bad habit.

Mentions the cash register as a piece of technology that significantly reduced
employee theft.

Encourages the use of technology/automation to make good habits easier and bad
habits harder.

### Make it satisfying

Make the habit enjoyable while doing it, so the odds it will be performed again
increase.
We are interested in immediate reward here, not delayed reward.

He proposes positive reinforcement to get an immediate reward from a habit while
waiting for the delayed reward that may come months or years later.
You do that by doing a short activity that you enjoy right after you have done
your daily habit you are trying to establish.

### Misc

Habit tracking: recording each time you do the habit, e.g., by marking on a
calendar, moving a paperclip to the done jar, etc.
The act of measuring provides visible reward and also keeps you honest.

No streak is perfect, so occasionally you will miss.
When that happens, don't miss twice in a row; that's the start of a new habit.
It is better to show up without being perfect.

Remember Goodhart's law, and don't let the measure become the target.

Some BS about genes in the final chapter.
Examples are from individual sports, info contradicts what we know about the
brain's plasticity.
(Contrast to Talent is Overrated and The Happiness Advantage.)

Steve Martin spent 14 years doing stand-up before he became famous.

The Goldilocks rule: you need to operate at the edge of your abilities to get
better.
Not too easy, not too hard.

Mentions people who meticulously track their habits and refine them to improve:
Kipchoge, Ledecky, but also more abstract domains like decision journal by
business leaders.

Periodically (say, twice a year) reviewing and refining your habits helps you
improve as the world around you changes.
