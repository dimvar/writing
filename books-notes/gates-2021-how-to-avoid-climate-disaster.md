## How to avoid a climate disaster -- notes

Apparently it is not enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we need to lower
them all the way to zero.
When you reduce emissions, you still warm up the planet, just doing it more
slowly.
He makes a big deal of that in the intro.

Also says that we need to deploy wind and solar as much as we can, but it is not
enough by itself, so other clean energy sources are needed too.

During 2020, global emissions went down by 5%, proof that we can't get to 0 by
traveling less.

Only a few degrees Celsius of change in the world's average temperature make a
big difference. During the last ice age, the temperature was 6 degrees cooler.
During the age of the dinosaurs, the temperature was about 4 degrees warmer, and
crocodiles could swim near the Arctic circle.

20-40% of the world's population lives in the areas that will be most negatively
affected by climate change.

If we keep current emissions rates, the projection is that climate change will
be about as deadly as a global pandemic by 2050, and 5x as deadly by 2100.

The current global average is 51 billion tons of greenhouse gases emitted per
year. Good to know this number, to compare it against efforts that reduce
emissions.

Breakdown of causes of emissions:

* Making things (cement, steel, plastic) 31%
* Electricity of homes/offices 27%
* Growing plants, animals 19%
* Transportation 16%
* Heating, cooling, refrigeration 7%

The world consumes 5000 gigawatts of power. The US consumes 1000 of that.

The average American house needs 1 kilowatt.

A big city needs about 1 gigawatt of power.

Power density is the amount of power produced by square meter. Nuclear has much
higher density than solar, which has much higher density than wind.
Nuclear's power density is comparable to fossil fuels'.

Green premium: how much more expensive is a clean solution to a problem compared
to fossil fuels? If it is way more expensive, e.g., 2x, poor countries won't be
willing to deploy it. If it is the same cost as fossil fuels, the reasons it is
not widespread are not financial; they can be social or political.

The US and Europe would have to pay 20 to 30% more in the best case to switch to
fully green electricity. The rest of the world more, due to lack of
infrastructure.

A problem with wind and solar is that they are not always available, so the
power produced needs to be stored, to be used at night or in the cloudy season.
Batteries are very expensive. Also, the grid may produce an excess of power when
the sun is shining, and the extra energy needs to be moved off somewhere.

Nuclear is the only clean energy source whose density and cost rival fossil
fuels, and is available 24/7. France gets 70% of its electricity via nuclear
energy.

The current nuclear plants use fission, the process of breaking particles apart.
There is another process called fusion, where you generate energy by smashing
particles together. Fusion is cleaner and less dangerous than fission, but the
technology is not ready yet, and it is not clear if it will ever succeed.

There is some clever work to store electricity from wind and solar without using
batteries. You can use energy to push water up a hill, and use the water later
to generate electricity when needed. Or you can store water pressurized
underground and release it later.

Carbon capture:
When you capture it right at the factories that release it in the air, it is
called point capture. When you capture it from the atmosphere later, it is
called direct air capture. Point capture is more effective than DAC because the
carbon is concentrated. In the atmosphere, only one in 2500 parts is carbon.

In the chapter about animals and agriculture, he mentions that animal burps and
farts are a major source of emissions. Animal poop as well, mostly from pigs
and cows.

Two types of possible meat replacements:

* Fake meat that tastes like real meat, e.g., the companies "impossible meat"
  and "beyond meat".
* Real meat that is grown in a lab.

Food waste is 20% in Europe and parts of Asia, and 40% in the USA. Responsible
for 3 billion tons of emissions!

Better crop varieties were key to improving yields and preventing possibly a
billion deaths in the 1970s and 1980s.

Producing ammonia in the lab and making fertilizer was another key invention
that significantly improved agriculture.

Deforestation accounts for 30% of emissions in the plants/animals category.

Planting trees helps but not nearly as much. Better to create incentives to not
remove existing trees.

Transportation is fourth cause in emissions worldwide, but first in the US!!

For cars and other city vehicles, the current best bet to go green is to make
them electric.

For large, long-range vehicles, such as trucks that carry goods, ships, and
planes, the weight of batteries makes this completely impractical. The current
best bet there is alternative fuels, or nuclear energy.

When a company's product has a cost that isn't paid by the company, but by
society, it is called an externality. The pollution caused by fossil fuel
companies is not reflected in the price of gas, which is cheap. Governments
should create policies so that fossil fuel companies pay for the emissions they
cause. This way, gas won't be artificially cheap, and clean energy will compete
on a level playing field.

The concept of a person's "carbon footprint" was created by BP marketers, to
direct blame for global warming away from BP. See
